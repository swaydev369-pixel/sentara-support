# Sentara – Terms of Service

**Last updated: August 22, 2025**

Welcome to Sentara. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Sentara mobile application (“App”) and related services. By downloading, accessing, or using Sentara, you agree to these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](https://swaydev369-pixel.github.io/sentara-privacy/). If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## 1) Acceptance of Terms
By using Sentara, you agree to these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](https://swaydev369-pixel.github.io/sentara-privacy/). If you do not agree, do not use the app.

## 2) Eligibility
You must be at least 16 years old (or the age of digital consent in your country) to use the App. If you are under the age of majority, you must have a parent or guardian’s consent. The App is not directed to children.

## 3) Subscriptions & Billing
Sentara offers free and paid tiers (Elevate, Awaken). Prices, trials, and renewal terms are shown in-app.  
Subscriptions auto-renew until canceled at least 24 hours before the period ends.

Manage or cancel via your platform account:  
- **Android:** [Google Play subscriptions](https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions)  
- **iOS:** [App Store subscriptions](itms-apps://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions)

Refunds are handled per platform policy and applicable law.

## 4) Tiers & Feature Gating
Some features are tier-limited. Examples:  
- **Daily Wisdom** unlocks at 7:00 PM local time. Free users may receive a short story; Elevate/Awaken users may receive full stories. Weekly story quotas may apply for non-Awaken tiers.  
- **Data Export** is available to Awaken members only and can be accessed in *Settings → Export*.

## 5) Your Content
You own your check-ins, reflections, goals, and journal entries. You grant us a limited license to process your content as needed to operate the app (e.g., storage, backups, insights). Do not upload illegal, harmful, or infringing content.

## 6) AI Features & Third-Party Services
Some features use artificial intelligence (e.g., narrative generation, insights). Your inputs may be securely sent to third-party AI providers (such as OpenAI) for processing per their policies. Outputs can be imperfect—use your judgment. See the [Privacy Policy](https://swaydev369-pixel.github.io/sentara-privacy/) for details.

## 7) Health & Safety
Sentara provides general wellbeing tools. It is not medical or mental-health advice, diagnosis, or treatment. In an emergency or crisis, contact local emergency services immediately.

## 8) Acceptable Use
Don’t misuse the app. Prohibited activities include (but are not limited to): reverse engineering the app; interfering with security or availability; attempting unauthorized access; using the app to harass, scam, or harm others. We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations.

## 9) Device Permissions & Data Storage
The app may request optional permissions (e.g., notifications). Most user data is stored locally on your device; some features may sync or transmit data (e.g., purchases, AI processing). See the Privacy Policy for details.

## 10) Changes to the Service
We may update, pause, or discontinue features at any time. Where reasonable, we’ll try to give notice for major changes.

## 11) Disclaimers
The app is provided “as is” without warranties. We do not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free operation or that outputs will meet your needs.

## 12) Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Sentara and its developers are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages from your use of the app. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; your rights may vary.

## 13) Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms. The “Last updated” date above will reflect the latest version. Continued use of the app means you accept the new Terms.
